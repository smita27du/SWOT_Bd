								<h4>About SWOT satellite data application in Bangladesh</h4>
								<p>Newly launched SWOT satellite holds immense potential for revolutionizing river monitoring and water resources 
									management, particularly in flood-prone and data-scarce countries like Bangladesh. By becoming a lower riparian 
									country with limited ground-based coverage, limited financial resources, and many remote or hard-to-reach regions, 
									the use of satellite-based data becomes essential for achieving consistent, wide-scale hydrological observation in 
									Bangladesh. In this project, river reaches observed by SWOT were identified using the SWORD, and time-series water 
									surface elevation data were retrieved through the Hydrocron API and then intergated in the front-end live server. 
									The real-time information will be vaulable for the stakeholder organizations who can get benefitted from SWOT 
									observsations where they cannot afford managing water monitoring gauges. In the next phase, we plan to 
									integrate the water heights from upstream rivers so that early signals of flood propagation can also be detected.</pp>

							<p>
								The key instrument is a Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn). Rather than a single nadir pulse, KaRIn measures height over a wide swath on either side of the satellite track, producing two parallel “strips” of elevation measurements plus a central nadir track. This lets scientists measure the surface elevation of oceans, lakes and rivers with high spatial detail. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

							  <h2>Fast facts</h2>
							  <ul>
								<li><strong>Launch:</strong> Launched December 16, 2022</li>
								<li><strong>Partners:</strong> A joint mission led by NASA and the French space agency CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the UK Space Agency.</li>
								<li><strong>Coverage:</strong> SWOT observes more than ~90% of Earth’s surface area in each 21-day orbital cycle (science repeat period).</li>
								<li><strong>Instrument highlight:</strong> KaRIn makes wide-swath height maps that reveal small-scale ocean features and river/lake elevations previously unmeasured from space.</li>
							  </ul>
					  
							  <h2>Why the mission matters — public benefits</h2>
							  <p>
								SWOT’s observations produce tangible benefits for people and the planet. Below are key ways SWOT data gets used:
							  </p>
					  
							  <h3>Flood & drought preparedness</h3>
							  <p>
								High-resolution measurements of rivers, reservoirs, and lakes improve flood forecasting, early warning systems, and drought monitoring. Knowing how water levels change over time helps emergency managers act earlier and allocate resources more effectively.
							  </p>
					  
							  <h3>Coastal resilience & sea-level planning</h3>
							  <p>
								By measuring ocean surface topography at finer scales, SWOT helps detect sea-level rise, coastal currents, and storm-surge risk — informing infrastructure planning, insurance models, and community protection strategies.
							  </p>
					  
							  <h3>Smarter water management & agriculture</h3>
							  <p>
								Farmers and water managers can use more accurate maps of freshwater availability and reservoir storage to optimize irrigation, conserve water, and maintain supplies during dry spells.
							  </p>
					  
							  <h3>Better ocean and weather forecasts</h3>
							  <p>
								SWOT reveals small ocean eddies and currents that influence regional weather, marine navigation, and fisheries. Feeding these measurements into ocean models improves forecasts important to shipping, coastal communities, and ecosystems.
							  </p>
					  
							  <h2>Who can use the data?</h2>
							  <p>
								SWOT data are made available to the public and research communities. That means scientists, governments, humanitarian agencies, farmers, coastal planners, and even curious members of the public can access and use the measurements to make better decisions. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
